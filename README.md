# CodeClauseInternship_WINE-QUALITY-PREDICTION

This project focuses on predicting wine quality using machine learning techniques.

## How it Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned and prepared for analysis. Missing values are handled, and categorical variables are converted into numerical format.

2. **Model Building**: A Random Forest Classifier is used to build the predictive model.

3. **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is assessed using accuracy metrics on both training and test data.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `python wine_quality_prediction.py` to execute the project.

## Prerequisites

- Python and necessary libraries. Install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Model Details

- Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
- Hyperparameters: Fine-tuned for optimal performance.

## Results

The model demonstrates strong accuracy in predicting wine quality.
